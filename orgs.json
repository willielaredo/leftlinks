We organize vigils, rallies, marches, educational forums, street theater, and civil disobedience actions to challenge the injustices of U.S. foreign policy. We believe in peace through justice, and we stand in solidarity with oppressed people here and abroad.\n\nThe Anti-War Committee works against direct US intervention around the world, including the inhumane use of drones to terrorize civilian populations. Our work to resist political repression began when the FBI raided our office and the homes of many of our members and friends in September 2010.  Because Israel is the top recipient of US military aid (supporting apartheid, last Summer‚Äôs horrific bombing campaign against Gaza, and the occupation the Palestinian people have been resisting for 65 years), ending US aid to Israel is at the top of our agenda.\n\nIn addition to working for a just foreign policy, the Anti-War Committee is committed to justice in this country. We support the Black Lives Matter movement and an end to racist police violence. We support the Welfare Rights Committee, the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Coalition and the Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Minnesota. We support justice for all, regardless of sexual orientation, and make Twin Cities GLBT Pride our biggest outreach event of the year.",

Our survival depends on a transformation to socialism. The U.S. working class, with a long revolutionary history and many powerful mass movements and organizations, has the potential to make this transition happen. That means building unity for peace, for protecting and expanding democracy, for living-wage jobs, for universal health care, for real equality for all those who are nationally or racially oppressed and women, for an end to the political control of the ultra-right over our political institutions, and for an end to the economic rule of the transnational corporations. Building and strengthening organizations of and alliances between the working class and its allies, winning real unity in the course of struggle, is the path from our current struggles towards socialism.",

These constitute a threat to world peace and are an obstacle to humanity successfully dealing with extremely serious common issues which confront it such as climate change, control of pandemics, racist discrimination and economic development.\n\nWe therefore believe that any New Cold War would run entirely counter to the interests of humanity. Instead we stand in favour of maximum global cooperation in order to tackle the enormous challenges we face as a species.\n\nWe therefore call upon the US to step back from this threat of a Cold War and also from other dangerous threats to world peace it is engaged in including: withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces agreement; withdrawal from the Paris Climate Change Accords; and its increasing disengagement from UN bodies. The US should also stop pressuring other countries to adopt such dangerous positions.\n\nWe support China and the US basing their relations on mutual dialogue and centering on the common issues which unite humanity.\n",

A world where power and participation flow from the bottom upwards and society is organized for peoples‚Äô aspirations, passions, and needs rather than profit, racial prejudice, patriarchy, or imperialism; and where we live sustainably with the planet.\n\nWe believe that this vision can only be brought about through the revolutionary power of the working class organized in the workplaces, community, schools, and streets to overthrow the state and capitalism and build a new world from the bottom up.\n\nAs those actively seeking to construct this vision we are inspired by the traditions of anarchist-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, especifismo, platformism, feminism, queer liberation, black liberation, abolitionism, anti-racism and their history of global struggle for liberation. We believe in the need for a political home from which to organize ourselves and put forward our vision. We believe in the need to create spaces for the development of new revolutionaries that allow the grouping together of similarly minded militants.\n\nWe see the need to build a specifically anarchist organization united around a common set of ideas, strategy, and practice. We believe that political organization should speak to the needs of our time, and act as a catalyst in struggles to expand their revolutionary potential. Political organization should be a vehicle to build, contribute to, and learn from social struggles.\n",

Our vision is of a society in which people have a real voice in the choices and relationships that affect the entirety of our lives. We call this vision democratic socialism ‚Äì a vision of a more free, democratic and humane society.\n",

Rooted in the experiences of Black people in this country who actively resist our de-humanization, #BlackLivesMatter is a call to action and a response to the virulent anti-Black racism that permeates our society.Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes\n\nIt goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all.\n\nBlack Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum.  It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements.  It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement.\n",

The organization is currently advocates \nfor U.S. policies in solidarity with people from Yemen and Burma, \ncommunities most affected by climate disasters, and low-income countries\n dealing with¬†COVID-19.¬†\n\n‚Äã\n\nAction\n Corps grew out of Oxfam and is volunteer-run, with 25 organizers in 10 \nstates. In 2019, Action Corps became a fiscally sponsored project of the\n Social Good Fund, which provides administrative services and legal \noversight. Action Corps is in the process of incorporating as a 501c3 in\n the state of New York.¬†\n\n‚Äã\n\nWhat is Action Corps' Mission?¬†The\n mission of Action Corps is to champion justice in solidarity with \npeople most affected by climate disasters and violent conflict. We \nachieve this mission by bringing together¬†diverse actors for \nhumanitarian advocacy, connecting grassroots activists to NGOs, media \nand members of Congress. \n\n‚Äã\n\nWhat do¬†Action Corps Organizers Believe?¬†We\n believe that every person‚Äîno matter where they are born or the body \nthey inhabit‚Äîhas a right to the resources they need. Our beautiful earth\n provides enough food and water for everyone, but climate change, \ngenocide, war and disease are¬†depriving millions of human beings. We see\n our well-being linked to the well-being of everyone, and we envision a \nworld where everyone has a seat at the table and no one is left out. We \nsee the struggles of Native people, immigrants, refugees, people of \ncolor, women, LGBT people, and all oppressed people, rooted in the \ncommon enemies of economic exploitation, White supremacy, and \npatriarchy. As we unite with communities struggling for liberation, we \nremind one another of the common thread of humanity that connects us. \nAlthough our campaigns are focused, we remember our broader common \nstruggle.¬†\n\n‚Äã\n\nWhere is Action Corps Active?¬†Action\n Corps currently has active organizers, board members, and/or mentors in\n the following ten states: CA,¬†IA, ID, IN, FL, MA, MN, NY, RI, VA. \nAction Corps also has an organizer in Washington, DC. If you would like \nto organize in your state or province, please reach out to \nnational@actioncorps.org.",
